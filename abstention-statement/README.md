# **Public Statement from Tingvard**

The Cardano Constitution requires that all Budget Info Actions receive a constitutional opinion from the Constitutional Committee (CC) under Article III, Section 4. This opinion is a mandatory step in the governance process, even though Budget Info Actions are not ratified on-chain.

At this time, the Constitutional Committee is operating below the required **minimum committee size**. According to CIP-1694, a CC below this threshold is **unable to perform its constitutional role**. The Guardrails Appendix reinforces that governance actions requiring constitutional review cannot proceed without an active and functioning CC.

Because the CC cannot currently issue the opinion required by the Constitution, the governance system is temporarily operating outside its normal safeguards.

For this reason, Tingvard will **abstain from voting** on the Cardano Critical Integrations Budget and all governance actions that require CC review until the Committee is restored above its minimum size. Abstaining to vote is the only position consistent with the Constitution, the Guardrails, and the intended design of the governance framework.

However, in the interest of transparency, we also confirm that Tingvard has completed its assessment of the *Cardano Critical Integrations Budget*. Once the Constitutional Committee is restored and able to perform its required constitutional function, Tingvard intends to vote **“Constitutional.”**

We look forward to returning to normal governance participation as soon as the CC is reconstituted.
