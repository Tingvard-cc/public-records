    "description": "Norwegian Block Exchange (where I work) as an EU partner to Moneta on the stablecoin USDM might potentially benefit from this proposal indirectly by it increasing the demand for USDM minting. Note I decided on an abundance of carefullness to vote abstain and it is no direct benefit from the proposal nor is it sure that USDM will be minted from the proposal. I will judge such indirect potential conflict of interests on a case to case basis",
