We would like to share that Arne Rasmussen has decided to step away from Tingvard due to other commitments. While we are, of course, sad to see Arne leave the consortium, we fully support his decision and are grateful for the dedication and energy he has brought to our shared work.

The remaining members of Tingvard will continue to serve, and Arne’s departure highlights one of the key strengths of a consortium: even when one member steps away, the group remains strong, stable, and collaborative. Our structure is built to endure change, and we remain committed to delivering the same high level of cooperation and professionalism.

At this time, no decision has been made regarding whether Tingvard will continue as a five-member consortium or if we will eventually look for a replacement. We will evaluate our options thoughtfully and communicate further when appropriate.

On behalf of the entire consortium, we extend our sincere thanks to Arne for his hard work, commitment, and contributions throughout his time with us. Most importantly, the friendship remains strong, and we wish him the very best.
